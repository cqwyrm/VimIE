VimIE
=====

AutoHotKey script, Vim-like key bindings for Internet Explorer (IE), works ONLY when IE is active.

Usage
=====

 
		Esc		toggle Vim/Normal mode
		c		duplicate current tab
		d		close current tab
		g		edit url address 
		h		go back in history
		l		go forward in history
 		j		move cursor up
 		k		move cursor down
		n		go to next tab
		p		go to previous tab
		r		refresh current tab
		u		reopen last closed tab
		t		open new tab
		w		go top
		s		go bottom
		/		search in page


Why
===
I have to use IE on my old laptop everyday. Chrome(Vimium) and Firefox(Vimperator) are just too slow. This script keeps my hands on the keyboard while browsing. Hopefully it will help you.
