VimIE
=====

Vim-like key bindings for Internet Explorer (IE). This AutoHotKey script works ONLY when IE is active.

Usage
=====
 
* `Esc`		toggle on/off Vim mode
* `g``n`	switch to the "n"th tab ( n is a number between 1 and 8, for example press `g` and `5` will switch to the 5th tab)
* `z``i`	zoom in
* `z``m`	zoom out
* `a`	add a bookmark
* `b`	go back to the last viewed tab
* `c`	duplicate current tab
* `d`	close current tab
* `h`	go back in history
* `l`	go forward in history
* `j`	move cursor up
* `k`	move cursor down
* `n`	go to next tab
* `o`	edit url address 
* `p`	go to previous tab
* `q`	open a search query in the address bar
* `r`	refresh current tab
* `u`	reopen last closed tab
* `t`	open new tab
* `w`	go top
* `s`	go bottom
* `x`	quit IE
* `/`	search in page

Why
===
I have to use IE on my old laptop everyday. Chrome(Vimium) and Firefox(Vimperator) are just too slow. This script keeps my hands on the keyboard while browsing. Hopefully it will help you. 

Todo
====
1. Add a tray icon or sound alert when Vim mode is off.
2. When the cursor is in the address bar or search box, turn off Vim mode automatically.
