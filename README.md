VimIE
=====

Vim-like key bindings for Internet Explorer (IE). This AutoHotKey script works ONLY when IE is active.

Usage
=====

 
		Esc		toggle Vim/Normal mode
		gn		switch to the "n"th tab ( n is an integer between 1 and 8)
		a		add a bookmark
		c		duplicate current tab
		d		close current tab
		o		edit url address 
		h		go back in history
		l		go forward in history
 		j		move cursor up
 		k		move cursor down
		n		go to next tab
		p		go to previous tab
        q       open a search query in the address bar
		r		refresh current tab
		u		reopen last closed tab
		t		open new tab
		w		go top
		s		go bottom
		/		search in page


Why
===
I have to use IE on my old laptop everyday. Chrome(Vimium) and Firefox(Vimperator) are just too slow. This script keeps my hands on the keyboard while browsing. Hopefully it will help you. 

Todo
====
    Add a tray icon or sound alert when Normal mode is toggled.
    When the cursor is in the address bar or search box, enter Normal mode automatically.
